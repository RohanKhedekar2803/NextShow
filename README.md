üîß Key Features
Federated Authentication: Integrated Google OAuth 2.0 for user login, with custom JWT tokens issued for secure and stateless internal authorization across services.

Microservices Architecture: Independent services for events, shows, bookings, users, notifications, and payments, enabling modular development and scalability.

Service Communication:

Synchronous communication with Feign clients for REST-based interactions between dependent services.
